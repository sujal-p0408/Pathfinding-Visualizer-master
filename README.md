# Pathfinder Visualizer

## Description

Pathfinder Visualizer is a tool designed to help users understand and visualize different pathfinding algorithms. It provides an interactive interface to see how algorithms like A*, Dijkstra, BFS, DFS and others work in real-time.

## Features

- Visualize various pathfinding algorithms
- Interactive grid where users can set start, end, and obstacle nodes
- Step-by-step visualization of the pathfinding process
- Adjustable speed of visualization
- Clear and reset grid functionality

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/sujal-p0408/Pathfinding-Visualizer-master.git
 
2. **Install dependencies:**
    npm install
    
3. **Start the application:**
    npm start

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Set the start and end points on the grid.
3. Add obstacles by clicking on grid cells.
4. Select a pathfinding algorithm.
5. Click the "Visualize" button to see the algorithm in action.
